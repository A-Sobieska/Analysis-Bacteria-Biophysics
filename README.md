# Summer research project 2018 at University of Edinburgh 

The aim of the project was to investigate bacterial waves on various amounts of nutrients present in the growth medium.

Selected Python scripts used to analyse optical densities of propagating bacteria (E. coli) in time on a 384-well microtiter plate are presented here.
